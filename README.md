## Overview

CipherDropX is a modern library designed for deciphering YouTube signatures using only regular expressions. It provides a fully dynamic parser that does not rely on JavaScript execution or abstract syntax trees (AST). This library supports the latest obfuscation methods used by YouTube, making it a reliable tool for developers and reverse engineers.

## Features

- **Regex-Only**: Utilizes regular expressions to decode signatures without executing JavaScript.
- **Dynamic Parsing**: Adjusts to various obfuscation methods in real-time.
- **No Dependencies**: Lightweight and modular design ensures ease of integration.
- **Supports Latest Obfuscation**: Keeps up with YouTube's updates to signature obfuscation.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick implementation.

```python
from cipherdropx import CipherDropX

# Initialize the deciphering object
decipher = CipherDropX()

# Provide the obfuscated signature
obfuscated_signature = "your_obfuscated_signature_here"

# Decode the signature
decoded_signature = decipher.decode(obfuscated_signature)

print(f"Decoded Signature: {decoded_signature}")
```
